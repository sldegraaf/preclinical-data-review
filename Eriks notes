Abstract
•	Note that they develop new model for the number close the mean
o	Means we should have higher scrutiny on that part 
•	Need to make sure we approach the p values correctly
o	Not just p value that this one dataset would appear this way
o	But instead that we would find at least one dataset that appears that way
o	This approach is more realistic and conservative
o	If the same individual has the anomalous data sets then we can account for that
Introduction
•	In terminal digits, how many digits required for trailing digit to be uniform?
Data Studied
•	Counts of the triple
o	How correct is this Possoin assumption?
o	Memoryless?
Mid Ratio
•	Why are there more data points for RTS then for the other investigators?
Mean in triplicate samples
•	I notice that the means in the pdf are all in the left columns
•	Can we determine if a large number of them are in the left column in the entire data set?
•	Or perhaps a run of means occurring in a given column?
•	Can we say anything analytically about this maximum probability? 
•	Could we use Chebyshev to bound the probability the data are close to the mean?
o	Maybe this is the opposite direction we want?
Hypothesis Test 1
•	They only count triples with distance of 2 or more
•	We should make sure this exclusion does not bias the results in some way
Coulter Counts
•	What is the incentive to fabricate these? Is there any? 
•	Table 2 shows some of the outside lab have z scores under -2, why are those not flagged as well?
Terminal Digit Analysis
•	What are the assumptions of the Chi Squared Goodness of Fit test?
